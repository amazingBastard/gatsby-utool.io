##### Expertise: #####

**Digital Products and Services**

We don't ship pretty-adjective nouns that marketing-verb your business to the next level. We deliver software that helps you work faster and produce better results.

**Prototypes over Presentations**

No fancy shmancy PowerPoints. We take an iterative approach to design and development that embraces feedback on functional prototypes.

**Team Game: Client + uTool**

We ask our clients to participate closely throughout the product development lifecycle. This creates products that are done right and get to market sooner.

**Small Teams. Senior Leadership.**

Each client engagement is led by a partner and a small, dedicated team.

##### Process: #####

**Learn, Launch, Loop**

We believe the only way to know whether an idea is viable is through field-tested prototypes. This frame forms our strategy for software development.

1. Learn the need and surrounding environmental factors
2. Launch with a testable, minimally viable prototype that may best address need
3. Loop through the learn and launch stages until the prototype iteration yields expected outcome
